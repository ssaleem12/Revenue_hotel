# Revenue_hotel
Data Analysis and Visualization using SQL and Power BI

# Requirements: 
Build Visualization data story/dashboard to present to stakeholder
  -Is out hotel revenue growing by year?
  -Should we increase our parking lot size?
  -What trends can we see in the data

# Topics I worked on:
Write SQL queries,
How to perform EDA to analyze data
Connect to Power BI for visualization

# We have created some visuals using Power BI that show some possible trends. Here are a few of them:
  -Revenue increased from 2018 to 2019, but it began to decrease from 2019 to 2020.
  -The average daily rate (ADR) has increased from 2019 to 2020, from $99.53 to $104.47.
  -Total number of nights booked by customers decreased from 2019 to 2020.
  -The discount percentage offered by the hotel has increased from 2019 to 2020 to attract more customers.
