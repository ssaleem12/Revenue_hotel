# Revenue_hotel
Data Analysis and Visualization using SQL and Power BI

# Requirements: 
Build Visualization data story/dashboard to present to stakeholder
  -Is out hotel revenue growing by year? <br />
  -Should we increase our parking lot size? <br />
  -What trends can we see in the data <br />

# Topics I worked on:
Write SQL queries <br />
How to perform EDA to analyze data <br />
Connect to Power BI for visualization <br />

# We have created some visuals using Power BI that show some possible trends. Here are a few of them:
  -Revenue increased from 2018 to 2019, but it began to decrease from 2019 to 2020. <br />
  -The average daily rate (ADR) has increased from 2019 to 2020, from $99.53 to $104.47. <br />
  -Total number of nights booked by customers decreased from 2019 to 2020. <br />
  -The discount percentage offered by the hotel has increased from 2019 to 2020 to attract more customers. <br />
